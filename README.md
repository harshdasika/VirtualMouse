# AI VIrtual Mouse

## About

This project is designed to create a virtual AI mouse that recognizes/interprets hand gestures in real-time, through the use of machine learning algorithms which rely on video input through the device's webcam. 

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository to local machine
2. Make sure all required libraries are installed (OpenCV, mediapipe, numpy, etc.)
3. Open project in any Python IDE; make sure Python 3.8 is the selected interpreter
4. Run VirtualMouse.py

## File Descriptions
